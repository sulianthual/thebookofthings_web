web version (2025):


modified code, 60 FPS to 20 FPS:
- 60 FPS was not consistently attained on web version
- share.py: fps and scl (scl=3 for 20 FPS)
- share.scl used for modifying physics (world.py), as well as tool/timer (tool now import share)
- Some minigames parameters adjusted manually (typically jumping initial rate, as was inconsistent with only share.scl)
- animations (draw/obj_animation) now play 1/3 frame. Sound during animation modified (detect sound within last 3 frames)
- other modifs i dont remember maybe

Added controls for page browsing (see page.py, chapter_page):
- Enter=next, tab=previous.
- Modified control display page (ch0 and menu)
- may now skip some games, beware if logic still ok
